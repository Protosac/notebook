It works like a No SQL database.

#### Salt
http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html

"The backbone of Salt is the remote execution engine, which creates a high-speed, secure and bi-directional communication net for groups of systems. On top of this communication system, Salt provides an extremely fast, flexible, and easy-to-use configuration management system called Salt States."

Masters and Minions = Server and Clients

"Salt states are YAML documents that describes the current state a machine should be in, e.g. what packages should be installed, which services are running, and the contents of arbitrary files." -- Vagrant Docs
