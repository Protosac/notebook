##Linked List
***
No indexes. Must go through entire list to find what you want. However, nodes are easier to remove because of this.

*Nodes* Have 2 properties - their name and next (the pointer). The last node has a `next` value of null.

Pros: Great for removing data.
Cons: Difficult to find data.
